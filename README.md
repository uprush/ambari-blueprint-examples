# Ambari Blueprints Examples

A few blueprints that make it really easy to walk through a wizard and launch HDP clusters.

## List of Blueprints

1. Sandbox Equivalent - Very cheap blueprint to run something up in amazon to play with our stuff
2. Small Cluster - Likely 8-10 nodes that represent a standard cluster.
3. HA Cluster - likely 20 nodes with HA that represents a good start on a real production cluster.
4. Streaming Cluster - Deploys 10 nodes including Storm and Kafka
5. Spark Cluster - Deploys a std. 10 node cluster correctly configured with Spark on YARN on the cluster.

## Known Issues
- HA cluster is working in progress.
